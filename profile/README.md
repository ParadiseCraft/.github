### About Us

Our primary mission is to create, build, and maintain a unique and high-quality Minecraft server experience specifically for the Ukrainian community. This GitHub organization hosts the code for our custom plugins, server infrastructure, and other tools that power our world.

### 🔒 Our Repositories

You may notice that most of our repositories are **private**. This is intentional, as they contain the proprietary code and custom development that make our server special. We protect our work to ensure a unique and stable experience for our players.
