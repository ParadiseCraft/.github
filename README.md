# ParadiseCraft Community Files

Welcome to the `.github` repository for the **ParadiseCraft** organization.

---

### What Is This Repository For?

This is a special "meta-repository" that holds our organization's default community health files. The files in this repository (like `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and templates for issues and pull requests) are applied by default to all other repositories within the ParadiseCraft organization.

Its purpose is to:
* Ensure consistency across all our projects.
* Streamline the process for bug reporting and feature requests.
* Provide clear guidelines for our internal development team.

### A Note on Our Repositories

As noted on our organization profile, the majority of our project repositories (for plugins, infrastructure, etc.) are **private**. This repository is public to provide a central point for our community guidelines.

### How to Contribute

We are not actively seeking code contributions via public pull requests on GitHub, as our development is handled internally.

However, we are **always** looking for talented developers to join our official team! If you are passionate about Minecraft and want to work on a large-scale Ukrainian server, this is the best way to contribute.

All open positions are listed on our wiki:

### Found a Bug?

If you are a player on our server and have discovered a bug, please **do not** create a GitHub issue. Instead, please report it using the official channels provided on our website or Discord server. This ensures our support team can track the issue and get it to the right developers.
